Code is current as of September 16, 2016, and was created to run on MATALB 2014a and onward.

If there are any problems with the code or suggestions, please contact me, Santiago Rodriguez, at sfrodriguez@ucdavis.edu.
Before getting started I'd like to thank Professor Jesus De Loera, for giving me the oppurtunitiy to do research over the summer, as well as, 
Professor Mimi Tsuruga for finding and helping me fix an error in Colley's Method which also appiled to Massey's Method. 


In this folder there are five functions used to determine the winner in some sort of election. 
All five functions follow the same input parameters ElectionMethod(CandidateName, VotingData) where,

CandidateName contains the names of all the candidates in a current election. CandidateName is a cell arracy of character vectors, whose format is as follows, 

C = {'Candidate1', 'Candidate2', ... ,'CandidateM'};

VotingData is an n-by-m matrix where n is the number of voters and m is the number of candidates. Each row in VotingData represents a voters preference for
every candidate ranging from 1 (worst) to 10 (best). VotingData has the following format,

V = [ v_11, v_12, ..., v_1m; v_21, v_22, ..., v_2m; ... ;v_n1, v_n2,...,v_nm];

The functions accept both explicit input, 
ElectionMethod({'Candidate1', 'Candidate2', ... ,'CandidateM'}, [ v_11, v_12, ..., v_1m; v_21, v_22, ..., v_2m; ... ;v_n1, v_n2,...,v_nm]);

or input given by variable names, 
ElectionMethod(C,V);
 
The latter input method is particularly handy when a large data set involved, as one can conver the data into a mat file and load it on MATLAB with a specific name.

The output of each function is "The winner is CandidateName"

Each function has a few lines of code commented out that makes the output a ranked list (highest to lowest). However instead of the candidates name appearing in the 
corresponding rank, it is the candidates position on the CandidateName list that is displayed. To clarify, for a three candidate election we have, 

C = {'Alice', 'Bob','Eve'};
Based on the list, Alice = 1; Bob = 2; Eve = 3;

After computing the results of the election with VotingData, we have the following ranking,

Eve    Alice   Bob

Our function would then give the following out put,

Ranking: 
3
1
2


These are all the things you need to implement the code, thank you for reading.
